        <p class="tag">Climate change is happening due to the greenhouse effects which cause global warming. Some gases affect climate change like, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) with an amount of 81%, methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) with an amount of 10%, Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) with an amount of 7% which are all greenhouse gases. To solve the climate change problem, these gases emission must be reduced to their least possible ratio. These gases can be reduced by different ways and solutions like:</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3 class="margin_left">1) Planting Trees: </h3>
        <p class="tag no_margin_left">To reduce carbon dioxide gas emissions in the air, more and more trees must be planted to absorb more carbon dioxide gas. This will not only help in reducing carbon dioxide gas and decreasing the global warming problem, but it will also provide the environment with oxygen gas which people need for breathing through a process called photosynthesis process. So, people should plant more trees as possible instead of cutting them as there are some people who are cutting and removing the trees to make use of their wood. This process is called deforestation. So, the deforestation process must be eliminated.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3 class="margin_left">2) Reducing Air Pollution: </h3>
        <p class="tag no_margin_left">Some types of air pollution emit carbon dioxide gases and other greenhouse gases that affect the environment and increase the global warming problem. From these pollutions are car exhaust, factory smoke, and others. These pollutions must be eliminated to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the air in many ways. For example, Reducing the number of trips that are taken in the car and trying to walk or using a bicycle, reducing, or eliminating fireplace and wood stove use, avoiding burning leaves, trash, and other materials, avoiding using gas-powered lawns and garden equipment. By applying these ways, the climate change problem can be reduced.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3 class="margin_left">3) Eliminate The Use of Non-Renewable Energy Resources: </h3>
        <p class="tag no_margin_left">The challenge is to stop burning coal, oil, and natural gas which are non-renewable resources. These energy resources must not be used; as they emit many greenhouse gases like, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) that cause an increase in the global warming phenomenon when these non-renewable resources are used to produce electricity. Thus, people should compensate for the usage of non-renewable energy resources that led to global warming by using renewable energy resources as solar energy, wind energy, hydro energy, tidal energy, geothermal energy, and biomass energy.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3 class="margin_left">4) The Whale Pump: </h3>
        <p class="tag no_margin_left">Phytoplankton colonies can be found anywhere whales, the world's largest living creatures are found. Not only do these microscopic creatures contribute at least 50% of all oxygen to our atmosphere, but they also capture around 40% of all CO<sub>2</sub> generated. To put it in perspective, this is the same amount of CO<sub>2</sub> captured by 1.70 trillion trees enough to cover four Amazon rainforests or 70 times the amount consumed each year by all the trees in the U.S Redwood National and State Parks. More phytoplankton equals more carbon sequestration. As a result, people must work to protect whales' lives.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3 class="margin_left">5) One Child: </h3>
        <p class="tag no_margin_left">There are 7.9 billion people living today. This huge number of people are consuming energy every day at high rates. Consuming energy means that a very big amount of fossil fuel, coal, oil, and natural gas is being burnt. Thus, a big amount of greenhouse gases will be emitted, and this will cause an increase in the global warming phenomenon. It is now clear that more humans mean more greenhouse gas emissions. So, the population must not be increased by a very big amount. This will only happen by decreasing the number of children. So, the solution is that each family can have only one child. Ultimately, a one child per couple rule is not sustainable either and there is no perfect number for the human population, but this will help in decreasing the climate change problem.</p>
